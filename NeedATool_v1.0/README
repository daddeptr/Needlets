NeedATool, is a software which encodes spherical needlets decomposition
of an input scalar field defined on the sphere.
For a detail discassion on how needlets perform, please, refer to 

"NeedATool: a Needlet Analysis Tool for cosmological data processing"
Pietrobon et al.

------  ------

Edit the Makefile in the source folder specifying the path for the 
Healpix library and the Fortran90 compiler as well the compiling flags.
Two examples are given.

When compiled two pieces of code are built: synneed, which computes needlets
fileters in harmonics space, necessary to compute needlets coefficients,
and the coefficients of a given map. The map has to be in Healpix
RING format.
Healpix can be downloaded from:
http://healpix.jpl.nasa.gov/healpixSoftwareGetHealpix.shtml
 
The second code is ananeed, which reconstructs a map, given the needlets
coefficients, previously computed with synneed.

Both pieces of code can be run in the interactive mode or providing a 
parsing file. An examples of parsing file s given. Please, modify it 
for your purpose.

Be aware that the code was written for research purpose.
Please, report any bug to:

davide.pietrobon@berkeley.edu

Enjoy it!
